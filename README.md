Google Data Analytics Capstone: 1 Case study (1st attempt)

The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate required me to complete this Case Study.

1) Ask Phase 

The goal is to establish the optimal marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members by analyzing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

2) The Prepare Phase

Motivate International Inc. has made the data available under the terms of this license link. https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement 
In addition, the data on cyclists can be found in the link. https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

The data presented was arranged within month and was thought to be reliable because it had been collected and published by the organization.
There were a few discrepancies in the statistics.
