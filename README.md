The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate required me to complete this Case Study.

The goal is to establish the optimal marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members by analyzing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

2) The Prepare Phase

Motivate International Inc. has made the data available under the terms of this license link. https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement
